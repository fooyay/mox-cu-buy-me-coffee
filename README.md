# Moccasin Project

🐍 Welcome to your Moccasin project!

## Quickstart

1. Deploy to a fake local network that titanoboa automatically spins up!

```bash
mox run deploy
```

2. Run tests

```
mox test
```

3. Run tests on a forked network
```
mox test --network sepolia --fork
```

_For documentation, please run `mox --help` or visit [the Moccasin documentation](https://cyfrin.github.io/moccasin)_

## Workshops
For the mid-lesson workshop, created a complex test, "test_multiple_funders_and_withdraw"

## Notes
To view the .deployments.db, add the SQLite Viewer extension to VSCode.
